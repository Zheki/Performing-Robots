# Waltz Robot

### For this homework I built a simple performing robot that dances the waltz and plays its own music. The robots body is an old shoebox which at for this version of the project I did not decorate in order to showcase simplicity. The robot moves in a predetermined order so that it would look like it is dancing the waltz. It is moved by two DC motors connected to a QWIIC motor driver. The driver is connected to a Sparkfun Redboard together with an LED switch, OLED display, and MP3 display with a small speaker. The LED switch is used to start the performance. Once the user presses the button, the robot starts dancing and playing music for about a minute. (4 waltz rounds). After it is done, it stops, and the user is able to press it again to repeat the performance. One challenge that I did not manage to overcome was making the OLED expression animated, so for this version of the project it simply displays a static image of a smiling mouth. However, this is the most important feature that will be fixed in the near future.
