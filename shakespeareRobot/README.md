# Shakespeare Robot

## The scene that I chose to recreate with my robot is the death of Duncan in Macbeth.
I am intending to record the scene mostly with close face shots. The characters that move in the scene will all be played by the same robot, dressed in different costumes to represent different characters (Macbeth, Lady, Duncan). Other characters such as the guards will be static, and they will be represented by other props. The secene will last for around one minute.
