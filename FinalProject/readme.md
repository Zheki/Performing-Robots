## Description:
For my final project a made a music video performance of a soviet era World War 2 song, in which the main performer was a robot. The song is about a young accordion player that 
goes to war to win a medal in order to impress the girl he loves, and he succeeds in achieving that. The performance visually shows the story of the song, syncronized with the singing 
in the background.
To achieve this, I created a simple robot that moves using DC motors, can rotate it's head left and right, and has an OLED display which displays a mouth on its face to portray simple 
emotion like happiness and sadness. The videos were shot with a mobile phone camera, and the scene was relatively small (see scene photo below). The chanigng of the scenery and showing 
the location of the robot i.e. a meadow, frontline, starry night, and forrest was done by using a greenscreen fabric behind the scene for easier change of backgrounds. After recording,
the videos were edited using Premiere Pro to stabilize them and change the backgrounds. Since the scene area was small, the videos were shot in multiple shorter scenes.
