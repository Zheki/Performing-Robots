# Final Project

## Idea
For my final project in Performing Robots I am planning to create a performance based on the Russian folk song On the Sunny Meadow (Na Solnechnoi Polyanochke). The story in the song talks about a young Russian accordion player who goes to war to win a medal in order to impress the girl he loves.

## Characters
The characters of the performance will be the boy and the girl. The boy will be presented in two ways. One as an accordion player, and the second as a soldier fighting in the war.

## Construction and Props
The charactes will be played by robots made out of cardboard and textile. The robots will be powered by two DC motors hidden inside the legs. THe form of the robot will be human-like. Their expressions will be shown by mouth movements displayed on an OLED display. Other movements such as hand movements will be modified by me between different shots. The performance will be made up of multiple short takes. Costumes will be designed from fabric and represent the era in which this story takes place. A medal, plastic weapon, and a small accordion will also be used as props.

## Scene
Since there are 3-4 scenes in the story of the performance, I will be using a green screen to display a background (meadow, war, night sky, etc.) The lighting will also change depending on the scene ranging from strong bright light to softer darker light with soft shadows.

## Technical issues
Although the DC motors are not very precise, large precision is not needed. The main problem might be the sliding of the wheels accros the surface which might cause uneven movements. This can be resolved in two ways. The first one is to increase friction between the wheels and the surface by putting a rubber material on the wheels, and the second is taking multiple shots and using the one in which the movements are best. All of the sound will be pre-recorded and edited using video software, therefore, there will not be any sound-problems.
